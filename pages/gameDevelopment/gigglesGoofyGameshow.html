                        Giggles' Goofy Gameshow is a 3D puzzle and platformer game developed in a team of six over the course of
                        one semester (around three months). I was the lead programmer, level designer, and UI designer, as well as contributing
                        to asset creation (modeling, texturing, and some animation) and writing.<br>
                        Some unique challenges for this project included saving and loading persistent game and player data, managing the time component of the games,
                        and balancing the gameplay and score system.

                                Giggles Goofy Gameshow is a game show from your childhood that got taken off the air
                                because it (allegedly) got too violent. Now you're brought into the show in a new reboot,
                                but you quickly find that all is not what it seems.<br><br>
                                You are actually stuck in Giggles' deranged reality where he is obsessed with his prior
                                glory and getting good ratings. He forces you to play crazy games inspired by his old show.<br><br>
                                The first game is Animal Scramble in which Giggles asks you to help him catch the runaway animals
                                and put them in the correct bins. But what is that grinding noise and flashing light? Surely this
                                is all family friendly entertainment.<br><br>
                                Next is Giggles' Funtime Circus where you can show off your hammer wielding prowess in a game of
                                whack-a-mole. Hit the Giggles (TM) jack-in-the-box popouts to score!<br><br>
                                Finally you enter the Playground where your platforming skills will be tested. Race to the finish line
                                and maybe you can finally get out of this crazy game and go home...or can you?

                            <p>
                                As a team, we began by brainstorming ideas. Our starting direction was to create a 3D puzzle game, and we drew inspiration
                                from Squid Game, Poppy Playtime, and The Amazing Digital Circus to set our initial concept, which was set in a gameshow with
                                a horror element mixed with children's play. We also determined that we wanted to include several mini games / puzzles in the gameshow.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The Initial GDD elaborated on the prototype document but did not change much. At this beginning stage, exploration was a key driver
                                in the game, and the hub played a major role in advancing the story. There would be items hidden around it which the player
                                needed to find to unlock the final boss battle. The details of the games were not finalized nor mapped out. 
                                The backstage level was just a small bonus area off of the playground puzzle, and the final boss battle was actually to take place
                                inside Giggles' show control room.

                                I created and maintained the project task board from which jobs were assigned and tracked. This greatly helped 
                                organize everyone's efforts and ensure the most important parts of our scope could be completed in time for the showcase.
                                Additionally, I kept an ongoing bug/issue list for my reference as the gameplay programmer and tester.

                                The final GDD reflected several changes we made during production due to time and scope creep. We streamlined and improved
                                the puzzle games. We also discarded the exploration idea in favor of a straightforward linear story to better show Giggles'
                                descent into madness. Finally, we cut the control room boss battle and instead rearranged the puzzles and let the backstage
                                be the boss battle. This also allowed us to use props and puzzles from the previous three games so the boss battle
                                is a culmination of everything the player learned.

                        <p>
                            I was responsible for planning and writing the entire game system structure. I wrote 100+ scripts, the largest code system for a project
                            I had done yet, which presented a challenge and required good practices and planning. My primary goals were to decouple
                            and write modular code to make the system more manageable and scalable. Below is a diagram of my code system including most of 
                            the key scripts.

                        <h2>Player</h2><br>
                        <p>
                            The core of the gameplay is the player's 3rd person movement and ability to interact with objects in different ways including picking up, dropping, throwing,
                            pushing, pressing (buttons), jumping, sprinting, and attacking. Also because YOU the player are stuck in the show, and leaderboards
                            and scores play a large role, player data was important. Finally, for accessibility and user experience, I wanted to have controller support.<br><br>
                            Therefore, I structured the player's scripts modularly so features could be added and each feature could take care of one aspect of the player's needs.<br><br>
                            Below is an example of how the player would interact with an InteractableObj to pick up, push, or drop it:
                            PlayerInteract receives messages from the input system when "interact" is pressed, setting interact (bool) true. The OnInteracting event,
                            which the InteractableObj listens to, is invoked. It is a func, so the InteractableObj returns itself (Transform), which the player can then
                            store a reference to and make its child. I set the object's collider to ignore the player's collider to prevent issues.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="sectionText centered">

                    <div class="sectionText">
                        <p>
                            I also highlight how the player throwing mechanic works: if the "throw" input is pressed from the input system, the bool is true and
                            the object the player has a reference to (i.e. is holding) is checked if it is throwable. if so, it is detached from the parent and thrown. If
                            the player is aiming, it will use a Physics raycast to determine the target of the aim. Then it will calculate the velocity change needed to apply
                            a force that will allow the object to reach that target, with clamping to an upperlimit as the player's limitations.<br>
                            If the player is not aiming, the object will launch in their forward direction with a set power.

                        <h2>Interactables</h2><br>
                        <p>
                            The interactable object script inherits from an abstract class that handles the UI (sending messages to a UI script to decouple). This way all objects
                            that the player can interact with have a uniform indicator for good user experience. Each child class implements a different type of interactable including
                            buttons, pickupable, etc. When the player enters its trigger, the object adds a listener to the player's interact event (triggered by input which itself is a message from
                            Unity's input system) and removes it when the player leaves. I designed the system to use events for communicating across scripts to decouple my code.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Managers</h2><br>
                        <p>
                            The game state manager stores the state of the game (paused, ended, in play) and sends an event on state change. For example, the player controller
                            freezes the player on pause. It also contains the logic for quiting and ending the game (saving the player data). There are many more managers which each
                            perform their own tasks so others can use their functions as needed. The scene load manager handles loading and unloading the scenes asynchronously. The player,
                            manager, global audio, and other global objects are in their own persistent scene, so the manager's job is to load and unload the puzzle room scenes additively.<br><br>
                            The dialogue and tutorial managers are triggered by objects in the world. They handle activating their corresponding UI. The dialogue manager in particular
                            handles parsing the script and acting as a middle between the user's input and the UI scrolling.<br><br>
                            The leaderboard manager contains a reference to the leaderboard data and handles saving, loading, and sending the data to the leaderboard UI in the world.<br><br>
                            The audio settings manager stores the volume level preference for music, sfx, etc. and sends messages to all the relevant parties so the levels are consistent.
                        </p>
                        <h2>UI</h2><br>
                        <p>
                            All the UI is handled by their own script which receives messages to update their content. That way the managers are decoupled and 
                            can perform their important functions without the UI at all, which is especially good for testing and modularity.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Scriptable Objects</h2><br>
                        <p>
                            I made ample use of scriptable objects to store persistent information across scenes as well as avoid singletons. I also used them to optimize
                            space by storing certian values once when there would be many or an unknown amount of instances in the world (like for the animals). They were a 
                            great interface between the managers and saving files on disk, especially for the player data.

                        <h2>Level Design</h2><br>
                        <p>
                            I was responsible for importing all assets into the game a building the levels. This was the largest 3D game I had worked on with multiple
                            rooms/levels and a 3rd person view, so getting the the camera and scale to feel right took some time. I enjoyed designing interactive environment pieces throughout the rooms to keep the player curious such as swinging doors,
                            pushable and throwable objects, and (the team favorite) a playable xylophone.<br><br>
                            At first, the hub felt too spacious, but as I laid out more set pieces, it became a cozy playroom as per the original concept. I chose to
                            move the doors to their own walls to give each a distinct area. They have their own leaderboards in both the hub and in the room itself so the player
                            has constant access. Each door also has its own spotlight which only lights when that puzzle is open (they unlock sequentially). I also played with
                            the lighting in the hub after each puzzle to increase the creepiness as Giggles gets more deranged. By the third puzzle, the main lights are off and only
                            the spotlights remain.<br><br>
                            It was important in Animal Scramble to give enough obstacles for Animals to hide behind and slow the player down, but not clutter the space and frustrate
                            the player. The room itself is decorated like a children's show farm set to play with the gameshow theme.

                            The most enjoyable level was the circus due to its wild lighting and shiny props. Originally I planned to include a glass floor over the boxes
                            which would pop out through holes, more like whack-a-mole, but having the player run around the boxes proved to be a better challenge.<br><br>
                            The most difficult level to build
                            was the playground level because of its comparatively large scale and dependence on scale for gameplay. It also needed to be 
                            designed in such a way to guide the player to the goal while also preventing cheating. Julia created the level design for the playground,
                            and I adjusted a few aspects upon building and playtesting it, such as dividing the floor and including drop platforms.<br><br>
                            The backstage level was also a unique challenge because of the timed running gameplay. The lighting was important for that level because the room was intentionally dark
                            allowing lighting to bring attention to important elements such as the Giggles boss, the remote, and key interactable objects.

                            I created many of the 3D models in the game in Maya, including the puzzle doors, animal chutes, wooden signs, jack-in-the-box,

                            I also rigged and animated the jack-in-the-box, and animated various other models in Maya or Unity including levers, animals, etc.
                            Additionally, I textured a majority of the models created by the art team and was responsible for asset import into the game.<br>
                            I used Adobe Substance Painter for the texturing, which was a new software for me which I learned for this project.

                            I also created UI elements including the tutorial popups, the stamina bar, interactable icons, diaolgue box, menu buttons, menu boxes, money meter, and timer.
                            I used Adobe Illustrator to create these.
