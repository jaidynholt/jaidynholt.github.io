                        This application uses a trained machine model for optical character recognition (OCR)<br>
                        to recognize text from an image of handwriting and then analyze it using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).

                        This project was developed in a team of two for the 2025 WiNGHacks hackathon.

                    <p>
                        Our project was inspired by our curiosity with computer vision and machine learning.
                        Machine learning models and computer vision were areas we had no experience in but were excited to try.
                        A relevant, unique challenge was recognizing handwriting,
                        which we also thought would would be a fun and interactive project to showcase at the hackathon expo.

                        We initially planned to train an open source machine learning model on a large handwriting data set,
                        so we began by searching for suitable datasets on Kaggle. However, even after finding several candidates, we realized
                        that training a model is a large undertaking and overscoped for this project, especially since we wanted to implement
                        user interaction too, so we pivoted to using a pre-trained model.<br>
                        Our research led us to Tesseract, an open source optical character recognition (OCR) engine. After our initial tests with Tesseract,
                        we discovered that it was not accurate enough for handwriting. We explored other handwriting-specific models, eventually<br>
                        discovering <a class="textLink" href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/trocr" target="_blank">TrOCR</a>, a
                        transformer-based model with many open source pre-trained models, including several trained on English handwriting.<br>
                        Celia was responsible for connecting the model to our app and testing it.

                    <h2>GUI</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was responsible for the user input and interface of the app. We
                        used <a class="textLink" href="https://opencv.org/" target="_blank">OpenCV</a>, which was great to learn and work with because
                        it was very robust and exactly what we needed for computer vision. It helped me more easily access the camera, which was a large
                        part of our idea to make the project real-time interactive (instead of requiring photos to be uploaded and accessed from file).
                        I saved the image and sent it to the model to recognize the text.<br>
                        The model was having trouble finding the handwriting in the raw camera image, especially when it contained people and backgrounds.
                        We solved this by first processing the image to make it more friendly for the model:
                        <b>auto-cropping</b>, detecting the bounding box of the paper and crop the image to remove distracting backgrounds;
                        <b>de-skewing</b>, detecting the tilt of the handwriting and applying transformations to correct the skew;
                        and <b>contrast adjustment</b>, increasing contrast to remove paper texture and printed lines.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="sectionText centered">

                    width="90%">
                </div>
                <div class="sectionText">
                    <p>
                        I was responsible for the app's graphical user interface. We decided this was a must-have; while initially testing the models, we relied on command line printing
                        and passing photo file paths into functions, which would make for slow and cumbersome user interaction. <br>
                        Firstly, I implemented a window to show the camera's feed and a countdown to display on the window using OpenCV. This was important because the photo needed
                        to be of a certain quality or the accuracy of the model would plummet. Trying to take a photo without knowing what the camera saw or when the camera took it
                        was an issue we found while testing.<br>
                        After taking the photo, it would apply the processing steps listed above and display the manipulated image. In particular, we found that the auto-cropping
                        was highly dependent on the quality of the photo, working best when the paper was held against a dark background. Often, it would not work as well, so I added
                        an additional crop button to the interface to allow the user to manually crop the image more.<br>
                        I also added a button to retake the photo, which aided testing and ensured the best possible photo would be sent to the model.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After clicking the button to confirm the image, we sent it to the model and then displayed the text output to the app.<br>
                        For a fun addition to the app, we decided to analyze the results and keep/display them as statistics to the GUI. We ran
                        the output through the <a class="textLink" href="https://www.nltk.org/" target="_blank">Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library</a> for a breakdown of its parts of speech.<br>
                        Then we displayed the results of the input, or had the option to display the statistics of all the users' inputs.

                        I used <a class="textLink" href="https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/" target="_blank">CustomTKinter</a> for
                        the GUI, a library based on Python's built-in GUI TKinter. Though I had some experience in building GUIs with React,
                        I was completely new to building a GUI in Python. I settled on CustomTKinter because of its ability to make clean,
                        designed windows quickly as opposed to TKinter. In addition, working with OpenCV's windows and drawing for the video feed and
                        photo capture was a unique challenge to work with the TKinter GUI.
