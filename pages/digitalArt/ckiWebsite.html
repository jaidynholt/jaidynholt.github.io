                    <h2>2024</h2><br>
                    <p>
                        Circle K International (CKI) is the world's largest student-led service organization
                        and the collegiate branch of the Kiwanis service organization.
                        As 2024-25 webmaster of the University of Florida chapter of CKI,
                        I designed the website and created original artwork and assets for it. The 2024-25 club theme
                        was "enchanted forest" to align with the CKI governor's literacy service project theme
                        "storybook."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can visit the live website here (although it has since been updated from my year):<br>

                            http://www.ufcki.org/
                        </a>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="sectionText centered">
                    <h2>Main Banner</h2>
                    <img src="../../images/CKI/Enchanted_forest_art_4.jpg" alt="Enchanted forest banner art" width="100%"><br>
                </div>
                <div class="sectionText">
                    <p>
                        To go along with the theme "storybook", I decided to keep all the artwork across the website in a consistent 
                        style reminiscent of children's pickture books and Winnie the Pooh. I went for thin black outines and watercolor/brush stroke colors.<br><br>
                        For the landing page of the website, I wanted to create a large banner piece of art as the first thing you see, welcoming visitors and
                        setting the theme of the website. For the theme of "enchanted forest", I set the artwork in a forest with a trail through it alongside
                        a river, to signify a spirit of adventure and a journey new places which fits CKI's community and leadership values.<br><br>
                        My first rough draft had a cool color palette and darker values. The forest seemed whimsical with purple and cyan coloring, but the tone 
                        was more mysterious, and did not have a welcoming feel that was right for a landing page. It was also devoid of any animal life except
                        the club's mascot Bubbles the shark in the water, which seemed to go against the idea of a trail through the forest and CKI's value of
                        fellowship.<br><br>
                        In the second draft, I included more animals to liven the picture. I chose animals because children's storybooks often feature animal 
                        characters and the choice was fun and played to the enchanted theme. I chose a gator for UF and FlaCKI the flamingo, the mascot for 
                        Florida CKI. I also themed them to fit in the world, making the gator a knight (representing you, the valiant club member),
                        FlaCKI a mage, and Bubbles a bard (for good times of course). These became recurring characters in the website art and were also used 
                        throughout the year for CKI branding.

                        I also changed the color palette to be warmer with more red and gold to brighten the scene and make it more magical.
                        Additionally I changed the light source so the path leads into the light rather than into the shadow, and the characters are leading the 
                        view down the path with them. Then I desaturated the colors
                        of the background slightly to make the characters pop out as well as make the tone softer like a children's book.
                        This made the artwork more welcoming as a landing page, and also set the color palette for the rest of the website theme and artwork.

                        CKI is organized around several committees including service, socials, recruitment, and so on. Each committee is led
                        by their chair who plans events every week for the members. On the website, each committee has their own page where members can 
                        sign up for the events. I wanted to give each of these pages their own landing art, particularly their own character to feature.<br><br>
                        I enjoyed thinking up ways to theme an animal character and their activity to represent each committee and settled on:
